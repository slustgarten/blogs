I was introduced to generative art by one of my college roommates, Norris. Since then, I’ve dabbled in Processing a couple of times but never got too far. 

A couple of years ago, I wanted to pick Processing back up and I had the idea to create a generative art piece that would create Cruz Diez paintings. If you don’t know him, Cruz Diez is a Venezuelan artist famous for his chromatic cinetism. Being from Venezuela, I’m a fan and would love to own one of his paintings. The nice thing about them is that they lend themselves really well to generative art as they are for the most part patterns with some randomness thrown in them.

With the recent craze in NFTs, I’ve reconnected with my interest in generative art as there are now burgeoning marketplaces with amazing artists and projects. If you are not familiar, I would encourage you to visit artblocks or fxhash for some really awesome art.

Given the growth in the space, I was inspired to pick back creative coding and bring my Cruz Diez project to life. It's a good excuse to finally learn creative coding, bring my Cruz Diez project to life, and combine this with my interest in NFTs to experience it from the maker point of view.

This post will be a running log of my journey from noob to NFT artist. I’ll document my raw learnings along the way, mainly for my self-reference, so apologies if it's not as clear written.

## Idea log
I'll keep a running list of ideas/thoughts at the top of the post:
- You can make cruz diez like paintings by trying to codify ina generative algorithm or by feeding ai a bunch of his images and then having the ai algorithm “paint” it. Maybe after i learn p5js I can teach myself how to do this with ai so i can compare the two.


## Day 0 - Dec 22nd

What would making a Cruz Diez entail? Lets explore his paintings and try to come up with some pseudo code.

One of the most emblematic Cruz Diez works is the one displayed at Maiquetía, Venezuela's International Airport, and with the mass migration of Venezuelan's, it's become a ritual to take a picture with it when you're leaving the country.

Here is the [artwork](https://www.bridgemanimages.com/media/images/65d94a3da709f2757cf686c08ede8254ff21c2ca.jpeg) and [here](https://www.instagram.com/p/q7QY7gKjpA/) is the picture I took when I left:

To figure out what's the algorithm making up the pattern, I'll use Figma to break the pattern down:

![Cruz Diez Breakdown](/assets/images/x10/cruz-diez-brakedown.png)

As you can see, the artwork can be decomposed into a main component of three parallel colored strips with a diagonal black one that is stacked again and again in multiple columns: 

![Cruz Diez putting it together](/assets/images/x10/making-cruz-diez.png)

So the pseudo code for this would be something like:

```
for the width of the canvas:
    for the height of the canvas:
        create a red strip
        followed by a green one
        followed by a blue one
        followed by a diagonal black strip
end
```
Doesn't look thaaat hard... and once I figure out how to do it, we can get creative with the strips and figures we superimpose.

But first, let's get to the basics. How do I create that basic component with code?


## Day 1 - Dec 24th

I was thinking of doing this project on Processing which is what I've tried in the past, but I finally decided to do it with P5.JS a javascript library for creative coding. As far as I can tell, it is inspired by Processing, but 'rebooted' for JS so it doesn't use the same syntax and is built to be browser first. 

In order to learn P5.js I looked at the project's website and the excellent ![Coding Train Videos](https://youtu.be/HerCR8bw_GE) by Daniel Shiffman. I highly recommend them, he is quirky, energetic, and most importantly explain things very clearly.

After the [2.3 video](https://youtu.be/7A5tKW9HGoM), things started to click for me on using variables for creating a repeating pattern. Here are a couple of examples I came up with, some "studies":

Played with randomness of color and sizes. Here are some “studies”.

## Day 2 - Dec 25th

Building on yesterday's foundation, today I ventured to make a first Cruz Diez.
