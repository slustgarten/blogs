I was introduced to generative art by one of my college roommates, Norris. Since then, I’ve dabbled in Processing a couple of times but never got too far. 

A couple of years ago, I wanted to pick Processing back up and I had the idea to create a generative art piece that would create Cruz Diez paintings. If you don’t know him, Cruz Diez is a Venezuelan artist famous for his chromatic cinetism. Being from Venezuela, I’m a fan and would love to own one of his paintings. The nice thing about them is that they lend themselves really well to generative art as they are for the most part patterns with some randomness thrown in them.

With the recent craze in NFTs, I’ve reconnected with my interest in generative art as there are now burgeoning marketplaces with amazing artists and projects. If you are not familiar, I would encourage you to visit artblocks or fxhash for some really awesome art.

Given the growth in the space, I was inspired to pick back creative coding and bring my Cruz Diez project to life. It's a good excuse to finally learn creative coding, bring my Cruz Diez project to life, and combine this with my interest in NFTs to experience it from the maker point of view.

This post will be a running log of my journey from noob to NFT artist. I’ll document my raw learnings along the way, mainly for my self-reference, so apologies if it's not as clear written.

## Idea log
I'll keep a running list of ideas/thoughts at the top of the post:
- You can make cruz diez like paintings by trying to codify ina generative algorithm or by feeding ai a bunch of his images and then having the ai algorithm “paint” it. Maybe after i learn p5js I can teach myself how to do this with ai so i can compare the two.


## Day 0

What would making a Cruz Diez entail? Lets explore his paintings and try to come up with some pseudo code.

One of the most emblematic Cruz Diez works is the one displayed at Maiquetía, Venezuela's International Airport, and with the mass migration of Venezuelan's, it's become a ritual to take a picture with it when you're leaving the country.

Here is the [artwork](https://www.bridgemanimages.com/media/images/65d94a3da709f2757cf686c08ede8254ff21c2ca.jpeg) and here is the picture I took when I left: https://www.instagram.com/p/q7QY7gKjpAiFGbYKbtiCnNEwRcYMVF1qheMsQ0/

To figure out what's the algorithm making up the pattern, I'll use Figma.

## Day 1

I was familiar eith processing but today I learned there is also p5js which is a js library for processing. Since I’ve also wanted to learn js, I decided to go for this instead of processing. Plus you can run it on the browser, etc.

Watched some of codingtrain’s videos. I highly recommend them, he is quirky, energetic and most importantly explains things very well.

Played with randomness of color and sizes. Here are some “studies”.


## Day 2
Building on yesterday's foundation, today I ventured to make a first Cruz Diez.
