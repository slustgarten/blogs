Yesterday I learned about [Genuary](https://genuary.art/). 

## Day 2 - Dithering
Dithering is tricking the brain to see more colors than there really are. [This article](https://surma.dev/things/ditherpunk/) covers the algorithms in depth, but I don't have as much time today to play with making this work in p5.js so I followed [Michael Connolly's](https://twitter.com/xiiixiii/status/1477560692903485443) steps and used a library called [Riso](https://antiboredom.github.io/p5.riso/) that implements dithering. I duplicated an [existing sketch](https://github.com/antiboredom/p5.riso/tree/master/examples/Halftone) with my own image and tweaked some of the parameters, to create images inspired by [Poolsuite's](poolside.fm) mobile app's aesthetic.


## Day 1 - Jan 1st
