I finally read Radical Candor after it had been recommended by several friends and colleagues. The book is a management philosophy book in the spirit of High Output Management, but the parts I found most useful were the frameworks around giving feedback and evaluating performance, which is where the book gets its title of radical candor.

The idea behind 'Radical Candor' as a management philosophy is that you give a damn about the people you work with. Giving a damn doesn't mean sugar coating feedback or not hurting people's feelings, but rather it means being honest with them to help them grow or find work they can be great at.

### The Radical Candor framework

The framework is pretty straightforward. It categorizes feedback along 2 dimensions - (1) caring, and (2) challenging. Caring goes from not caring to caring personally, and challenging goes from not challenging to being upfront about it. The book argues that caring personally and challenging directly is where you want to be at (this is **"Radical Candor"**). This means being transparent with people, telling them where they can grow, how they can improve, and helping them get there, and doing it from a good place.

The second best you can do is to be **"obnoxiously aggressive"**. This means you challenge directly without coming from a place of caring. This might sound counterintuitive, but the point is that at least here you're telling people how to be better (even if you're hurting their feelings). Without this, you're not giving your team the opportunity to improve.

**"Ruinous empathy"** is when you don't challenge someone because you don't want to hurt their feelings. This is ruinous because you're not doing them any favors, just robbing them of time they could use to get better. Lastly, you have **"manipulative insincerity"** which is the worst of all attitudes as you neither care nor challenge the person, you're just letting them rot.

I'm a sucker for 2x2 frameworks and found this one particularly helpful in that it helps you caliber how you're approaching performance issues with people on your team and with yourself. It is also useful as a common framework for your team to be able to tell you if you're being an obnoxious asshole, if they feel it's radical candor, etc.

### Superstars vs Rockstars

Another useful framework from the book is the superstar vs rockstar framework.
