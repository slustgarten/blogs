### About me
Startup guy with experience as entrepreneur, operator, and investor. Generalist at heart, but I love building product, growth, and marketing organizations (I've done it a [couple of times](https://www.linkedin.com/in/slustgarten/) and it's been a ton of fun). I'm into philosophy, math, econ, and history, so I'm obviously into crypto/web3 as it combines all of these beautifully (lustgarten.eth). If you'd like to connect on social, you can find them all on lustgarten.xyz or [get in touch](mailto:saul@lustgarten.xyz). 

### Why this blog?
I started this blog to try to write more, learn in public, and play with Jekyll/Github. I'm using the [sidey](https://github.com/ronv/sidey) theme and hosting on Netlify.

Posts that are still in formation have a #wip tag to them (I'm prioritizing publishing over editing, so apologies for grammar mistakes and unclear writing). 

### Other projects
Coming soon...
